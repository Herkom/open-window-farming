## 3. Reservoir Bottle

Tools/Materials needed for this step:
Tools: 1" (2.5 cm) diameter hole saw, marker, razor blade with fresh blade(s)
Materials: (1) 1.5 liter bottle

1. Find the bottle that was masked from the bottom to top with a 1" (2.5 cm) band. This is your Bottom Reservoir Bottle. Using 1" (2.5 cm) diameter drill bit, drill a hole in the bottom of the bottle. Go slow and steady when drilling so that the bottle will not collapse. It will take approximately 20-30 seconds before the bit will pierce the plastic.

2. Download and print the bottle cutting templates. Print them unscaled on a letter-sized piece of paper. It is a pattern for the Bottom Reservoir Bottle. Follow the directions on the sheet as to how to mount it to the bottle.
