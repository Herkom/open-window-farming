3. Screw a cup hook at the center of two WindowFarms columns. If your window sill has depth, mount the lights as close to the glass pane as possible. Using 18" (46 cm) of bead chain coupler, loop the bead chain around the lamp cord near the base of the lamp socket. Suspend the light column assembly from the cup hook.
