## Bottle Covering

Tools/Materials needed for this step:
Tools: painter's masking tape, scissors
Materials: (5) 1.5 liter bottles, white paint, masking tape

If it's a viable, universal solution to a common problem, it may be folded in to the next version release!

2. Getting Started: Download and print the Windowfarms v3.0 parts list. It contains a list of specific parts and recommended sources. Alternatively, by buying a kit, you can get in on wholesale batches of specialized parts while supporting both the Windowfarms Project and the disabled workers who assemble kits.

3. Section 1: Bottle Covering Each Windowfarm v3.0 column is made of 5 bottles: 4 plant bottles and 1 bottom reservoir bottle. Plant bottles and reservoir bottles are made slightly differently. This how-to addresses how to make the bottles for one column. Windowfarm instructions work best with 1.5 liter bottles made by Nestle waters, which produces Arrowhead, Calistoga, Deer Park, Ice Mountain, Ozarka, Poland Spring, and Zephyrhills brands in the United States. The waist of these bottles uniquely accomodates the hydroponic net cup. Extensive modification of the design will be needed if you get a different kind of bottle and root health and system evaporation rates can't be guaranteed. Use recycled bottles, not new ones!!

4. Part of each bottle must be covered to prevent the plants' roots from being exposed to light. The roots will not be able to act as roots if they are exposed to light. You also need to protect the nutrients in the bottom reservoir bottle from U/V light damage. Dark parts of the system are also less likely to grow algae. You can cover the bottles with tape or find some creative way of making them opaque (knitting cozies?). Here, we're demonstrating the popular spray paint covering method.

5. Fill an empty bottle with about 2"(5 cm) of water to weigh it down. Remove label with scissors without scratching the bottle. Remove as much glue/paper residue as is possible.

6. Using painter's masking tape, mask 4 of the bottles from the "waist" to the base.

7. Using 1" (2.5 cm) wide masking tape, mask the 5th bottle with one ribbon from the cap to the base.

8. Paint bottles with spray paint, providing even coverage. It will take 2-3 coats to create a layer of paint that will not let sunlight penetrate. Once dry, remove the masking tape from all bottles.

## Plant Bottles

Tools/Materials needed for this step:
Tools: 1" (2.5 cm) diameter hole saw, marker, razor blade with fresh blade(s)
Materials: (4) 1.5 liter bottles

1. Gather the 4 bottles that were masked from the waist to the base. These are your Plant Bottles. Using 1" diameter drill bit, drill a hole in the bottom of each bottle. Go slow and steady when drilling so that the bottle will not collapse. It will take approximately 20-30 seconds before the bit will pierce the plastic.

2. Download and print the bottle cutting templates. Print them unscaled on a letter-sized piece of paper. It is a pattern for the Plant Bottles. Follow the directions on the sheet as to how to mount it to the bottle.

3. Trace the Plant Hole onto the bottle.

4. While the paper pattern is still on the bottle, mark and poke the Suspension Holes in the side of each bottle near its base using a sharp razor.

5. Mark the Cap Flap with its direction facing away from each Plant Hole, towards the rear of the bottle. Use the paper template to help align the direction of the Cap Flap.

6. Remove the cap and remove cap lock ring with scissors, razor blade, or snips.

7. Cut the Cap Flap with a sharp razor. Replace the cap on the bottle.

8. Using a sharp razor blade, cutout the Plant Hole.

9. Repeat the prior steps on the other bottles: Marking and cutting the Plant Hole, poking the Suspension Holes, removing the cap lock ring, and cutting the Cap Flap.

10. Flush all bottles with water.

## Reservoir Bottle

Tools/Materials needed for this step:
Tools: 1" (2.5 cm) diameter hole saw, marker, razor blade with fresh blade(s)
Materials: (1) 1.5 liter bottle

1. Find the bottle that was masked from the bottom to top with a 1" (2.5 cm) band. This is your Bottom Reservoir Bottle. Using 1" (2.5 cm) diameter drill bit, drill a hole in the bottom of the bottle. Go slow and steady when drilling so that the bottle will not collapse. It will take approximately 20-30 seconds before the bit will pierce the plastic.

2. Download and print the bottle cutting templates. Print them unscaled on a letter-sized piece of paper. It is a pattern for the Bottom Reservoir Bottle. Follow the directions on the sheet as to how to mount it to the bottle.

3. Trace the Water Hole onto the bottle.

4. While the paper pattern is still on the bottle, mark and poke the Suspension Holes in the side of each bottle near its base using a sharp razor.

5. Using a sharp razor blade, cutout the Water Hole.

6. Flush the bottle with water.

## Suspension System

Tools/Materials needed for this step:
measuring tape, wire snips
Bead Chain, Bead Chain Couplers

1. You can use other materials like string to hang your windowfarm cheaper. Bead chain is much easier to take on and off for cleaning, is stable, easy to adjust, modular and makes a great tube cleaner for algae buildup too.

2. Daisy-chain all 5 bottles by removing each cap and screwing the mouth through the hole drilled in the base of the one below it. Align all the Plant Holes and Water Hole (in the bottom reservoir bottle) in one direction

3. Re-attach the caps to the bottles, making sure the Cap Flap is pointing away from each Plant Hole. The idea of the Cap Flap is to direct the dripping water away from the Plant Hole of the bottbelow. Set aside the column of bottles.

4. Measure and cut one 126" (320 cm) length of bead chain

5. Measure and cut 5 (five) 4.75" (12 cm) lengths of bead chain. Add a bead chain coupler to each end

6. Gather all 4.75" (12 cm) pieces with bead chain couplers on the ends. Take one end of the 126" (320 cm) chain, and thread it through the center holes of the bead chain couplers on one side of the 4.75" (12 cm)pieces. The seams of the bead chain coupers should be facing away from the end of the chain.

7. Repeat the process for the other side of the 126" (320 cm) chain and the couplers on the other side of the 4.75" (12 cm) pieces.

8. Starting a few inches from the ends of the 126" (320 cm) chain, space and snap-in-place the end couplers at 11.5" (29 cm) intervals.

9. Do this on both sides of the 126" (320) cm) chain.

10. You will end with a ladder effect.

## Mounting & Installation

Tools/Materials needed for this step:
measuring tape, drill
(2) Cup Hooks

1. For each column of bottles, put two cuphooks into the wall above the window, spaced 4" (10 cm) apart.

2. Hang the bead chain ladder on the hooks, with the looped end at the top.

3. Merge the bottle column with the suspended chain by uncoupling one side of each of the horizontal 4.75" (12 cm) pieces and feeding it through each bottle's Suspension Holes.

4. Once fed through, recouple the horizontal bead chain piece. You may have to spend some time adjusting the system to get it straight. Your system should now be suspended.

## Plumbing System

Tools/Materials needed for this step:
Tape measure, marker, scissors, needle nose pliers, hacksaw or razor blade, fine grit sand paper
Rigid Tubing, Flexible Vinyl Tubing, Check Valve, Poland Springs "sports" drinking cap, Metal inflation needle, Presta stem, Sealing washers, Plant tape

1. Mark the rigid tube with a marker to create three lengths: 28.5 inches (72.4 cm) 28.5 inches (72.4 cm) 3 inches (7.6 cm)

2. Score the rigid tube at the marks with a razor blade and snap, or use hacksaw to cut at the marks.

3. If necessary, lightly sand ends of tubes to remove debris from sawing.

4. Mark flexible tube with a marker to create two lengths: 1 inch (2.5 cm) 7 inches (17.8 cm)

5. Cut the flexible tube at the marks with scissors.

6. Attach the 3" (7.62 cm) rigid tube piece to one end of the 7" (17.8 cm) flexible tube. Overlap the pieces by 1/2" (1.2 cm).

7. Attach the other end of the 7" (17.8 cm) flexible tube to one end of one 28.5" (72.4 cm) rigid tube. Overlap pieces by 1/2" (1.2 cm).

8. Use the 1" (2.5 cm) flexible tube join the two 28.5" (72.4 cm) rigid tubes.

9. Measure and cut 2 (two) 12" (30.5 cm) pieces of plant tape.

10. Stick one end of the tube assembly into the Water Hole of the bottom bottle in the suspended system.

11. Stick the flexible end of the tube assembly to into the hole of the top bottle. Use the plant tape to wrap the top bottle near the waist, capturing and securing the water tube to the top bottle. Use a zip-tie through the back side of the bottle to point the outlet of the tube towards the rear of the bottle.

12. Use the second piece of plant tape to secure the tube assembly to the middle bottle near the tube assembly's midway joint.

13. Bottom Cap Assembly We have provided two methods for Do-It-Yourself assembly of the bottom cap depending on the size of check valve you received with your pump. Use the image on the right as a reference to find our which Method to use to construct the bottom cap. If you have the larger 0.8" (2.03 cm) diameter check valve (check valve on the left) then use Method A. If you have the smaller 0.6" (1.52 cm) diameter check valve (check valve on the right), or any other check valve, use Method B or Method C.

14. Method A With needle nose pliers, remove the filter in the hole of the sports cap, making an unobstructed hole.

15. Check to make sure the check valve is operational. Blow through one end, then the other. It should only allow air to pass through in one direction. If air can pass through in both or no directions, PetCo has provided you with a faulty valve. Please contact them to get a replacement check valve. Attach a metal inflation needle to the outlet stem of the check valve. (It says "OUT" on the valve). Align it first with your fingers, then use pliers to screw down the valve with hard pressure. The threads inside the metal inflations needle should dig into the plastic of the check valve's stem.

16. Stick the air hose included with the PetCo pump through the end of the cap and attach with the inlet end of the check valve.

17. Seat the check valve securely inside the cap.

18. With even, firm pressure, screw the cap into the bottle with your hand. Insert the water tube assembly over the top of the air needle. Screw the cap assembly onto the bottle with your hand. Insert the water tube assembly over the top of the air needle. The water tube should be seated as far down over the metal inflation needle as possible, and will be at an angle. This angle creates a very important gap to allow water to enter the tube. Attach the other end of the air hose to the pump's outlets.

19. Method B This method requires additional parts: a Presta threaded longstem bicycle inner tube (with stem washer), and two 1/4" ID 1/2" OD sealing washers. Drill a 1/4" (6.2 mm) hole in the center of the bottom bottle's cap.

20. With a hacksaw, cut the valve off of the rubber tube near its base.

21. With pliers, remove the valve at the top of the stem.

22. Take the presta stem and face the tapered end to the right. Slide one sealing washer on to it with the rubber side facing to the right.

23. Next slide on the cap, with the inside facing to the right.

24. Next, slide on another sealing washer, with the rubber side facing to the left.

25. Next, attach the metal inflation needle to the threaded tapered end of the presta stem. Using pliers, tighten as tight as possible.

26. Next, thread-on the presta stem washer from the opposite end, and use it to tighten the entire assembly. Use pliers to tighten the assembly as tight as possible.

27. Attach a 1" (2.5 cm) length of air hose included with the PetCo pump to the end of the threaded Presta stem, followed by the check valve. Attach the other end of the air hose to the PetCo pump's outlets.

28. Screw the cap assembly onto the bottle with your hand. Insert the water tube assembly over the top of the air needle. The water tube should be seated as far down over the metal inflation needle as possible, and will be at an angle. This angle creates a very important gap to allow water to enter the tube. Attach the other end of the air hose to the pump's outlets. IMPORTANT: The water tube MUST be seated over the air needle, with the air needle as far inside the water tube as possible. If you don't do this, no water will flow in the water tube, and instead air will bubble in the bottom bottle reservoir. Read more at the bottom of this page.

29. Method C This method requires additional parts: A double-barbed 0.170" to 0.170" plastic threaded bulkead with nut (available from industrialspec.com) per column. One 1/4" ID 1/2" OD sealing washer, per column. Find the cap for the bottom bottle. Drill a 1/4" diameter hole in the center of the bottom bottle reservoir cap. If there is already a hole in the cap, make sure it is 1/4" in diameter (you may need to enlarge it). Remove any rough edges in necessary.

30. Slide the sealing washer into the threaded shaft of the bulkhead, leading with the metal side of the washer.

31. Stick the bulkhead/needle assembly into the cap through its 1/4" hole. Once fully seated, the threads of the bulkhead should be on the outside of the cap and the rubber sealing washer on the inside of the cap should be touching the inside surface of the cap.

32. Next, add the plastic nut and tighten as much as possible. Consider using small pliers to help create a tight seal.

33. Using a short length of 3/16" ID flexible airline tubing, attach the outside end of the bulkhead to the outlet end of the check valve. Blow in the checkvalve to verify its direction. You should be 'blowing into the cap'.

34. At the bottom bottle, insert the water tube assembly over the top of the air needle.

35. Screw the cap assembly onto the bottle with your hand. The water tube should be seated as far down over the metal inflation needle as possible, and will be at an angle. This angle creates an important gap to allow water to enter the base of the tube. IMPORTANT: The water tube MUST be seated over the air needle, with the air needle as far inside the water tube as possible. If you don't do this, no water will flow in the water tube, and instead air will bubble in the bottom bottle reservoir. Read more at the bottom of this page.

36. Connect the other end of the check valve to one end of the 2.5' lengths of airline tubing

37. Connect the other to one of the pump's outlets.

38. Troubleshooting the flow of water:

  1. Seat your tube. The base of the water tube needs to be completely seated over the top of the air needle. This means you want the tip of the air needle as deep inside the water tube as possible, creating at least a 1 inch 'overlap' between the tip of the needle (where the air bubbles are released) and the base of the tube (where the water enters the tube). This distance helps prevent the air bubbles from escaping. You may need to use tape or the plant strips to keep the base of the water tube seated, preventing it from 'scooting up' and reducing your overlap distance. NOTE: You do not want the base of the water tube to be completely obstructed by the air needle. Doing so would not allow water to enter the tube! There should be a small gap at the base of the water tube that allows water to enter the base of the tube.

  2. Keep the water high - Keep the water level in your bottom bottle reservoirs high. As the water level drops in the bottom bottles, the pressure on the water column reduces. This situation increases the likelyhood of air bubbles escaping from the base of the water tube instead of traveling up inside of it!

  3. Adjust your pump - A proper air flow rate is critical to provide enough force to carry water up the water tubes. If the air flow rate is too low, the air flow will not be strong enough to overcome the weight of the water in the tube. In this case, and no water will travel up the tube and instead the bubbles will escape from the bottom of the water tube. To adjust the output rate of the air bubbles, use the knob on top of your pump. NOTE: There are factors that influence the required power setting of the pump, including: - The length of the airline tube running between the pump and the bottom bottle. Shorter lines are more efficient and will generally require a lower power setting. Avoid having significantly different lengths of airline running to the same pump.

  4. Straighten your water tube - Maintaining a straight, vertical, plumb water tube is critical to efficient water flow up the tube. Use tape and/or the plant tape strips to straighten the tube.

## Adding Lights

Tools/Materials needed for this step:
(2) CFL bulbs (full color spectrum), (1) cup hook, (1) lamp socket on wire, (1) lamp pin socket, 18" (46 cm) bead chain measuring tape, snips, drill

1. Start with a corded clip light and remove the shade. Consider using CFL bulbs with plastic domes to help prevent shattering of the bulb against your window.

2. Next, mount the pin socket to the cord, 2 feet (61 cm) down from the light socket end.

3. Screw a cup hook at the center of two WindowFarms columns. If your window sill has depth, mount the lights as close to the glass pane as possible. Using 18" (46 cm) of bead chain coupler, loop the bead chain around the lamp cord near the base of the lamp socket. Suspend the light column assembly from the cup hook.

## Adding Plants

Tools/Materials needed for this step:
Hydroton clay pellets, Plastic net cups, Plants

1. If using plants that were grown in soil, start by shaking-out the soil thoroughly.

2. Put each plant in a netcup with clay pellets.

3. Install your plants into the WindowFarm by sliding it through the plant hole. Please visit our web community for recommendations on plant placement: http://our.windowfarms.org

## Full Assembly

Tools/Materials needed for this step:

1. WindowFarm columns can be mounted side-by-side in a window. Each light column can supply light to two WindowFarm columns. Both the lights and the pump can be on different timers. Create a "drip loop" with all electrical wires to prevent any leaking water from running into the electrical outlets.

## Maintaining

Tools/Materials needed for this step:
measuring tape, scissors, snips
Plant Nutrient Solution or Powder, Bead Chain, Bead Chain Coupler, Cotton String

1. Adding Water Fill the reservoir bottle with enough water to reach just below the hole. Water will evaporate from your system and will need replacement. Expect to top-off the system 2-3 times per week. However, conditions will vary effecting the rate at which more water is needed. Winter seasons and dry environments will require more frequent watering.

2. Adjusting the pump Use the dial on the air pump to adjust the flow rate of the water through your system. The flow should be just enough to create a steady drip of water through the system. A flow that is too high will create unnecessary power consumption and noise. A flow that is too little will create wilted plants. However, some plants like wetter conditions than others.

3. Adding Nutrients

  * Phase 1- First ten days after plants develop roots) 1 teaspoon per gallon 3-20-20 (+ pinch=0.1 teaspoon epsom)= 1/2 teaspoon per bottle twice a week for 6 weeks= 4.75 teaspoons;

  * Phase 2- Seedling through vegetative phase) .396 teaspoon Maxsea 16-16-16 twice a week (+ pinch=0.1 teaspoon epsom) for 6 weeks= 4.75 Maxsea 16-16-16; 

  * Phase 3- Transition, last 2 weeks before flowering) 0.198 each of both kinds of Maxsea twice a week (+ pinch=0.1 teaspoon epsom) for approximately 2 weeks= 3/4 teaspoons of each Maxsea; Phase 4- Flowering and fruiting) 2 teaspoons per gallon of 3-20-20 (+ pinch=0.1 teaspoon epsom) = 3/4 twice per week for 4 weeks= 6.25 teaspoons Phase 5- Last 10-15 days before harvest) Feed your plants only water to flush the system

4. Setting the timers At first, set the timer on a 15 minute interval as pictured. Adjust as you observe plant response. Consult the web community for recommendations on pump and lighting (optional) schedules for the different life stages of your plants. Consult the timer's package for directions on setting the timer.

5. Pollination Using a small paint brush, mimic a bee's action and dust the pollen from one flower to the other, addressing each flower on the plant.

6. Flushing the system Place a bucket beneath the column to catch the draining water. Unscrew the bottom cap to flush the system. Start by flushing twice per week and adjust the frequency based on your plants' response. Consult the web community to troubleshoot issues with your plants.

7. Trellising plants As plants grow taller, use plant tape or fishing wire secured to the suspension system to create an adjustable support structure.

8. Cleaning tubes and bottles The tubes and the reservoir bottle will slowly accumulate algae growth on the inner walls. While not harmful to the plants, the algae reduces water flow efficiency.

9. Start by measuring and cutting one 30" (76 cm) piece of bead chain.

10. Measure and cut an 18" (46 cm) piece of cotton cord. Loop the cord back and forth in 3" (7.6 cm) lengths in your hand.

11. Measure and cut one 4" (10 cm) piece of cotton cord. Tie it with a double knot around the center of the 3" (7.6 cm) looped cotton cord bundle.

12. Thread one end of the 4" (10 cm) cotton cord piece through the center hole of a bead chain end coupler. You have created a small mop head. Snap the mop head assembly to one end of the 30" (76 cm) bead chain.

13. You now have a cleaning device for your water tubes. If the walls of the water tube accumulates algae, remove the tubes from the system and pull them apart at the connection joints. Use this tool to clean the tubes by feeding the beaded end of the chain down the tube, and pull-through. The mop head will drag algae with it. Rinse the mop head with water after each pull and repeat as many times as is needed.

14. Measuring and Adjusting the pH levels Gather a pH test strip and the reference card.

15. Dip the testing end of the pH strip into the bottom bottle, fully immersing it in the solution for a few of seconds.

16. Remove the strip from the water and wait 10 seconds. Compare the color of the strip to the closest match on the reference card. The pH of properly balanced water is between 7.0 and 7.5. You want your nutrient solution to be in this range so that the plants' roots can most effectively absorb the nutrients. The most common time you will need to rebalance your solution's pH levels are after adding fresh nutrients and/or changing the entire bottom bottle's water solution. Once you identify a pattern of how to balance your pH given your nutrient type, stick to it for best practice. In order to raise the pH level, you need to make your solution more basic. The simplist way to do this is to add a pinch of baking soda. In order to lower the pH level, you need to make your solution more acidic. The simplist way to do this is to add a few drops of distilled vinegar.

17. Apply your baking soda or vinegar as needed, and retest the solution's pH once everything has dissolved.
